        "*   Based on a passing threshold of 50, there are 7 'Pass' and 3 'Fail' categories.\n",
        "*   The length of both the `grades` array and the `categories` list is 10.\n",
        "*   The data type of elements in `grades` is `int64`, and the data type of elements in `categories` is `str`.\n",
        "*   The unique labels in the `categories` list are 'Fail' and 'Pass'.\n",
        "*   The mean grade is 64.50, and the median grade is 66.00.\n",
        "*   The pass rate with a threshold of 50 is 0.70 (7 out of 10).\n",
        "*   With a new passing threshold of 60, the classification of grades changed.\n",

        "*   The implemented logic allows for easy adaptation to different passing thresholds without needing to rewrite the core categorization loop.\n",
        "*   To further enhance the analysis, calculating the mean, median, pass rate, and fail count for the new threshold of 60 would provide a comparative view of performance under different criteria.\n"
